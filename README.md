Dotfiles and system setup.

Based on http://github.com/paulmillr/dotfiles. See that repo for documentation. Many undocumented changes have been made here.

Sets up the following
- git (gitconfig, gitignore)
- zsh (highlighting, autocomplete)
- sublime 3 (theme = Soda Light, color = Dawn, font = Source Code Pro, various settings)
- mac os (finder, spotlight, safari, various settings)
- ssh (generates key if one doesn't exist, opens github to paste it in)
- homebrew, brew-cask

Remember to install Source Code Pro from here https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/downloads. Download it, open Font Book, +

Download and symlink dotfiles

This will clone jepetty/dotfiles into ~/Developer/jepetty/dotfiles, then symlink ~/.files to ~/Developer/jepetty/dotfiles/home/.files

```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jepetty/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```

---

Bootstrap new system

This is a lot heavier and will change lots of system settings. Read bootstrap-new-system.sh before executing it. This will also download and symlink dotfiles.

```
curl --silent https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jepetty/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
cd ~/Developer/jepetty/dotfiles
sh bootstrap-new-system.sh
```
